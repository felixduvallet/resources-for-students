Resources for students
===================

This collection is primarily intended to serve as a resource for students working with [me](https://github.com/felixduvallet/)

These are resources and recommendations of tutorials, handy references, and other useful links.
I have sorted them into categories, and ordered them as essential, advanced, or master level.
I have either found them useful to me personally or a student working with me.

If this is useful to you, let me know!
Suggestions from others are welcome via pull requests.
However, please keep in mind that I will balance completeness (a large collection of links) with useful terseness (the smallest set of links that is useful) to prevent eyes-glazed-over syndrome.
