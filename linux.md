Linux
=====

Essentials
----------

  - Virtual box: run linux without needing to go all-in. https://www.virtualbox.org/
  - Ubuntu: a good place to start with linux. http://www.ubuntu.com/
  - Sublime is a nice all-purpose editor that is fast and easy to use. https://www.sublimetext.com/

Advanced
----------

  - Use my [dot-files](https://github.com/felixduvallet/felixd-admin/), especially for bash and git. At the very least, it will make me faster when I work on your computer.
  - CMake files are an important way of specifying build jobs. This is a good reference. https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-commands.7.html

Master
----------

  - Try linux mint once you're familiar with linux, it's a more streamlined version of Ubuntu. http://www.linuxmint.com/
