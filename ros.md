ROS: Robot Operating System
=====

Essentials
----------
  - ROS tutorials: You must have a good understanding of nodes, topics, and messages before moving forward with ROS. http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials
  - ROS launch files: These are a convenient way to start a whole bunch of nodes with different options. http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch

Advanced
----------

  - Topic remapping: http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/remap
  - rosdep & wstool: These two tools allow you to very explicitly specify dependencies (both apt-get packages and from-source repositories). http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep http://wiki.ros.org/wstool
  - rosparam: The ROS parameter server is a good way to set ... wait for it ... parameters. http://wiki.ros.org/rosparam

Master
----------

  - include one launch file in another: Reduce duplicated parts of multiple launch files by including launch files. http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/include
  - dynamically reconfigure ROS parameters.
