Programming
===========

Essentials
----------

  - stack overflow: your problem has probably been solved and documented here. If not, you should ask. http://stackoverflow.com/
  - python reference guide: keep this handy. https://docs.python.org/2/reference/
  - C++ reference guide: keep this handy. http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/
  - matplotlib: a good way to plot things in python fast. http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html

Advanced
----------

  - Good coding style is important for lots of reason.
      - Use the google style guides for [c++](http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) and [python](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
      - Python also has a style guide (and associated checking tool)called [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
      - C++ has cpplint.py: https://github.com/google/styleguide/tree/gh-pages/cpplint
      - Emacs can automatically use the Google style guide. https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/google-c-style.el
  - Two IDEs I like for are PyCharm (python) and CLion (C/C++).

Master
----------

  - pypi is a good way to install python modules. 
  - For prettier python plots (and lots of statistical analysis tools), check out the seaborn library. http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/
  - The [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html) python module is a nice way to parallelise your computation. You will need to understand the GIL (global interpreter lock) and why it's important. zoom zoom!
